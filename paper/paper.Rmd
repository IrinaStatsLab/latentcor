# Summary

The R package *latentcor* provides estimation for latent correlation with mixed data types (continuous, binary, truncated and ternary). Comparing to *MixedCCA*, which estimates latent correlation for canonical correlation analysis, our new package provides a standalone version for latent correlation estimation. Also we add new functionality for latent correlation between ternary/continous, ternary/binary, ternary/truncated and ternary/ternary cases.


Compare to MixedCCA, standalone, new functionality, memory footprint.

# Statement of need
Currently there is no standalone package dealing with latent correlation for mixed data type like we did in *latentcor*. The R package *stats* [@team2013r] have some functionality to calculate different type of correlations (Pearson, Kendall and Spearman). The R package *pcaPP* [@croux2013robust] provides a fast calculation for Kendall's \tau. The R package *MixedCCA* [@yoon2020sparse] have functionality for latent correlation estimation as an intermediate step for canonical correlation analysis on mixed data.
No package deal with latent correlation across mixed data type.

 Definition for Kendall tau.
 Describe the theorem states expected value of kendall tau = F(r). refer to table for reference of formula.
 A sentence to describe two methods: slow original vs interpolation.
 Table to show memory improvement compare to mixedCCA.
 Generate data for pairs.
 One example of original call, one for interpolation call.
