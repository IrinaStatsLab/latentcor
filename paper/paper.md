# Summary

We present `latentcor`, an R package for correlation estimation from data with mixed variable types. Mixed variables types, including continuous, binary, ordinal, zero-inflated, or truncated data are routinely collected in many areas of science. Accurate estimation of correlations among such variables is often the first critical step in statistical analysis workflows. Pearson correlation as the default choice is not well suited for mixed data types as the underlying normality assumption is violated. The concept of semi-parametric latent Gaussian copula models, on the other hand, provides a unifying way to estimate correlations between mixed data types. The R package `latentcor` comprises a comprehensive list of these models, enabling the estimation of correlations between any of continuous/binary/ternary/zero-inflated (truncated) variable types. The underlying implementation takes advantage of a fast multi-linear interpolation scheme with an efficient choice of interpolation grid points, thus giving the package a small memory footprint without compromising estimation accuracy. This makes latent correlation estimation readily available for modern high-throughput data analysis.

# Statement of need
No R software package is currently available that allows accurate and fast correlation estimation from mixed variable data in a unifying manner. 
The popular `cor` function within R package `stats` [@team2013r], for instance, allows to compute Pearson's correlation, Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's
$\rho$, and a faster algorithm for calculating Kendall's $\tau$ is implemented in the R package `pcaPP` [@croux2013robust]. Pearson's correlation is not
appropriate for skewed or ordinal data, and its use leads to invalid inference in those cases. While the rank-based Kendall's $\tau$ and Spearman's $\rho$ are
more robust measures of *association*, they cannot directly be used as subsitutes for statistical methods that require Pearson correlation as input (a prominent example is, e.g., graphical model estimation [@xue2012regularized;@yoon2019microbial]). The R package `polycor` [@fox2019poly] is designed for ordinal data and allows to computes
polychoric (ordinal/ordinal) and polyserial (ordinal/continuous) correlations based on the latent Gaussian model. However, the package does not have functionality
for zero-inflated data, nor can it handle skewed continuous measurements as it does not allow for copula transformation. The R package `correlation`
[@makowski2020methods] in the `easystats` collection provides 16 different correlation measures, including polychoric and polyserial correlations. However, 
functionality for correlation estimation from zero-inflated data is lacking. The R package `mixedCCA` [@yoon2020sparse] is based on the latent Gaussian copula 
model and can compute latent correlations between continuous/binary/zero-inflated variable types as an intermediate step for canonical correlation analysis. 
However, `mixedCCA` does not allow for ordinal data types. The R package `latentcor`, introduced here, thus represents the first stand-alone R package for 
computation of latent correlation that takes into account all variable types (continuous/binary/ordinal/zero-inflated), comes with an optimized memory footprint, 
and is computationally efficient, essentially making latent correlation estimation almost as fast as rank-based correlation estimation. 

# Estimation of latent correlations

## The general estimation workflow

The estimation of latent correlations consists of three steps: 

* computing Kendall's $\tau$ between each pair of variables,

* choosing the bridge function $F(\cdot)$ based on the types of variable pairs; the bridge function connects the Kendall's $\tau$ computed from the data, $\widehat \tau$, to the true underlying correlation $\rho$ via moment equation $\mathbb{E}(\widehat \tau) = F(\rho)$;

* estimating latent correlation by calculating $F^{-1}(\widehat \tau)$. 

We summarize the references for the explicit form of $F(\cdot)$ for each variable combination as implemented in `latentcor` below.

## Efficient inversion of the bridge function

In `latentcor`, the inversion of the bridge function $F(\cdot)$ can be computed in two ways. The original approach (`method = "original"`) relies on numerical
inversion for each pair of variables based on uni-root optimization [@yoon2020sparse]. Since each pair of variables requires a separate optimization run, the
original approach is computationally expensive when the number of variables is large. The second approach to invert $F(\cdot)$ is through fast multi-linear
interpolation of pre-calculated $F^{-1}$ values at specific sets of interpolation grid points (`method = "approx"`). This construction has been proposed in
[@yoon2021fast] and is available for continuous/binary/truncated pairs in the current version of `mixedCCA`. However, that implementation lacks the ternary
variable case and relies on an interpolation grid with a large memory footprint. `latentcor` includes the ternary case and provides an optimized interpolation 
grid by redefining the bridge functions on a rescaled version of Kendall's $\tau$. Here, the scaling adapts to the smoothness of the underlying type of variables 
by simultaneously controlling the approximation error at the same or lower level. As a result, `latentcor` has significantly smaller memory footprint (see
Table below) and smaller approximation error compared to `mixedCCA`.

## Illustrative examples 

To illustrate the excellent performance of latent correlation estimation on mixed data, we consider the simple example of estimating correlations between continuous and ternary variables. 

First, we use `latentcor` to generate synthetic data with two variables of sample size 500, and true latent correlation value of 0.5. We then estimate the correlation using the original method, approximation method (default) and standard Pearson correlation.
```r
library(latentcor)

# The first variable is ternary 
# The second variable is continuous. 
# No copula transformation is applied.
set.seed(2346)
X = gen_data(n = 500, types = c("ter", "con"), rhos = 0.5)$X
# Estimate correlations
latentcor(X = X, types = c("ter", "con"), method = "original")$R
latentcor(X = X, types = c("ter", "con"))$R
cor(X)
```
The original method estimates the latent correlation equal as 0.4766 (and approximation method is very close with the value 0.4762). 
In contrast, applying Pearson correlation gives an estimate of 0.4224, which is further from the true value 0.5.

To illustrate the bias for Pearson correlation, we consider truncated/continuous case for many different values of true correlation. Figure \ref{fig:R_all}A displays the values obtained by using standard Pearson correlation, revealing a significant estimation bias with respect to the true correlations. Figure \ref{fig:R_all}B displays the estimated latent correlations using the original approach versus the true values of underlying ternary/continuous correlations. 
The alignment of points around $y=x$ line confirms that the estimation is empirically unbiased. Figure \ref{fig:R_all}C displays the estimated latent correlations using the approximation approach (`method = "approx"`) versus true values of underlying latent correlation. The results are almost indistinguishable from Figure \ref{fig:R_all}B at a fraction of the computational cost.

The script to reproduce the displayed results is available at [latentcor_evaluation](https://github.com/mingzehuang/latentcor_evaluation/blob/master/unbias_check.R).



We next illustrate application to `mtcars` dataset, available in standard R. The `mtcars` dataset comprises eleven variables of continuous, binary, and ternary data type. The function `get_types` can be used to automatically extract these types from the data. After the types are determined, the correlation matrix can be estimated using either the original method or the approximation method.

```r
library(latentcor)
X = mtcars
# Extract variable types
type = get_types(X)
# Estimate correlations
latentcor(mtcars, types = types, method = "original")$R
latentcor(mtcars, types = types)$R
```

Figure \ref{fig:R_cars} shows the $11 \times 11$ matrices with latent correlation estimates (with default `approx` method, left panel), Pearson correlation estimates (middle panel), and their difference in estimation (right panel). Even on this small dataset, we observe absolute differences larger than $0.2$.
